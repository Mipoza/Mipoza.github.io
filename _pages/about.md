## About Me

I am currently in the final year of my engineering studies at École des Ponts, while simultaneously pursuing two Master’s degrees at Sorbonne University: a Master 2 in Fundamental Mathematics and a Master 2 in Analysis and Modeling. My academic focus is rooted in mathematical analysis, with particular interests in the control theory of partial differential equations (PDEs), specifically stabilization techniques, as well as in differential and Riemannian geometry.

This past summer, I had the opportunity to undertake a research internship under the supervision of Amaury Hayat at CERMICS. This experience led to the drafting of a research paper on the stabilization of semilinear parabolic PDEs using F-equivalence methods. The paper is not yet published but will soon be available as a preprint.

I was honored to receive the Fermat Junior Prize 2023 for a thesis I wrote under the guidance of Amaury Hayat as part of my training at École des Ponts. The thesis, titled *"Contrôle et stabilisation des systèmes dynamiques, application au pendule double"*, is available for download [here](files/Rapport_prix_fermat_junior.pdf).
