## About Me

I am currently in the final year of my engineering studies at École des Ponts, while simultaneously pursuing two Master’s degrees at Sorbonne University: the Master 2 in Fundamental Mathematics and the Master 2 in Analysis and Modeling. My academic focus is rooted in mathematical analysis, with a particular interest in the study of partial differential equations (PDEs).

My work spans various areas, including the theory of PDE control, specifically stabilization techniques, as well as differential and Riemannian geometry, where I am fascinated by geometric analysis.

In 2023, I was honored to receive the Fermat Junior Prize for my research on the stabilization of PDEs. Currently, I am preparing my first research paper, which is expected to be published soon, although it is not yet available as a preprint. I am passionate about mathematics and aspire to pursue a PhD in the field, with the ultimate goal of contributing to the academic and research community.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy engaging in philosophical debates, playing and composing piano music, and exploring mathematical topics such as Riemannian geometry, mathematical physics, and dynamical systems.
