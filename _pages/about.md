## About Me

I am currently in the final year of my engineering studies at École des Ponts ParisTech, while simultaneously pursuing two Master’s degrees at Sorbonne University: a Master 2 in Fundamental Mathematics and a Master 2 in Analysis and Modeling. My academic focus is rooted in mathematical analysis, with particular interests in the control theory of partial differential equations (PDEs), specifically stabilization techniques, as well as in differential and Riemannian geometry.
